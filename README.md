# python-shitty-malware

This shitty project is consisted of 3 files a server a client which controls the victim script through certain commands.
This project is not well made I am still new to programing so dont judge ;(

Guide to use the file transfare system:

  - if you wish to get a file from the victim on your computer simply find the directory of that file through the cmd system present and paste the directory in the "Transfare
  directory" lable and browse the directory in which u want that file to be saved in. (DONT USE QUATATIONS WHEN TYPING THE TRANSFARE DIRECTORY!) and click "send for client"
  
  - if you wish to send a file from your computer to the victim paste the directory of that file in the "Trasfared directory" label and paste the directory in which you want
    the file to be saved in (extracted from the cmd tool) on the victim's computer and click "send for victim"
